# Exmap
This repository contains code for the paper titled "ExMap bla bla" at CVPR 2024.

## Datasets
The setup for Waterbirds and CelebA are exactly the same as [here](https://github.com/anniesch/jtt/tree/master). For C-MNIST, we use the setup in [[1]. For UrbanCars, we use the setup in [2]. The latter dataset is available privately upon request. 

## Dependencies

Run 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

A smoother alternative is to pull our image from Docker:

```
asl021/whacamole:latest
```

## Running ExMap

### C-MNIST

### Waterbirds
